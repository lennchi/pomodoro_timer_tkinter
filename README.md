üçÖ The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique))

This timer uses four 25-min long intervals separated by 5-min breaks, and then one long 20-min break at the end of the 4-rep cycle.

GUI is implemented with Tkinter.
